## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student studying Data Science at UC San Diego. I was an Associate Data Engineer who has experience building End-to-end pipelines, and I also have experience building machine learning models from my past role as a Machine Learning Engineer. I am also very interested in doing data analysis projects, as utilizing data to make more optimal decisions is a passion of mine, having utilized data-driven approaches to improve at a variety of competitions. This github portfolio will mainly center around such Data Analysis projects.**
