## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student studying Data Science at UC San Diego. I was an Associate Data Engineer with experience in building end-to-end data pipelines. I also have experience building CNN deep learning ML Models from my past role as a Machine Learning Engineer.

I am passionate about data analysis, utilizing data to make more optimal decisions, and have utilized data-driven approaches in all facets of my life, both professional and personal. This github portfolio's purpose is to document my journey to improve my understanding of each part of the data lifecycle.
