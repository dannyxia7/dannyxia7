# Hi, I'm Danny ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate student studying Data Science at UC San Diego. I was an Associate Data Engineer with experience in building end-to-end data pipelines. I also have experience building CNN Deep Learning ML Models from my past role as a Machine Learning Engineer.

I am passionate about data analysis, specifically utilizing data to make optimal decisions. I have used data-driven approaches in all facets of my life, both professional and personal. This github portfolio's purpose is to document my journey to improve my understanding of each part of the data lifecycle.

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! Below are some of my key projects showcasing my skills in data science, machine learning, NLP, and more.
