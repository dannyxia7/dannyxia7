## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am an Associate Data Engineer who has experience building End-to-end pipelines, and I have experience building machine learning models from my past role as a Machine Learning Engineer. I am also very interested in doing data analysis projects, given my degree in Statistics from Berkeley! This github portfolio will mainly center around such Data Analysis projects.
